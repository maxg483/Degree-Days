# Accumulated or Growing Degree Days Modelling

# This technique is designed to determine the growing rate of a plant species into different growth forms that might be commonly associated with it. This methodology will be done off of several aquatic plant species that have designated thresholds of growth such as from seed to sprout then sprout to flower then flower to seed or what have you. This is something that has been done for numerous agricultural species such as corn and soybean however, this methodology has been made for species that have unknown degree days or base thresholds for growth. This particular code was developed by Dr. Gray Turnage at Mississippi State University Geosystems Research Institute which I'll be streamlining and using for several interested research projects.

# In due time as well I'll be adding general steps and explanations for everything which will be compiled and hopefully available for further use.
